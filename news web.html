    <h2 >Aakash Chopra on LSG's potential releases ahead of IPL 2026 auction</h2>
    <span class="time biu" id="x">-12-11-2025,12:00 pm</span>

    <p>Cricket analyst Aakash Chopra recently shared his views on the Lucknow Super Giants’ (LSG) p
        ossible player releases ahead of the IPL 2026 auction. He suggested that the team could consider 
        letting go of expensive players such as Rishabh Pant, Mayank Yadav, and Ravi Bishnoi to free up
         funds for rebuilding</p>

    <p>According to Chopra, these three alone account for nearly ₹49 crore, and releasing them could give LSG more
         flexibility to strengthen their squad after a disappointing 2025 season. He added that while these players 
         are talented, their high price tags and inconsistent performances make it 
        difficult for the franchise to maintain balance in the team.</p>
